/* A decoy first segment: the filter reads it, the server never does.
 *
 * TCP retransmits anything it has not had acknowledged, so a decoy is only
 * safe if the bytes the kernel will resend can still be changed after they
 * have gone out once. Linux can: pages gifted to the socket with
 * vmsplice(SPLICE_F_GIFT) stay writable, so the retransmission carries the
 * real request.
 *
 * Windows cannot, and the failure is worse than having no decoy at all.
 * TransmitFile hands the bytes to the transport when it is called, so
 * rewriting the file afterwards changes nothing and the decoy itself is
 * delivered. Worse, our decoy is the real request with only the server name
 * swapped, so the server answers it with a well-formed handshake — the attempt
 * passes our reply check, gets remembered as "this technique works", and the
 * browser then fails on a certificate for the wrong name, for every later
 * visit. A technique that cannot be verified is not worth a cached lie, so it
 * is not built there. Windows reaches the same filters through tlsrec, split,
 * disorder and oob — the combination Turkish users actually run — and through
 * Advanced mode, which does this properly at the packet layer.
 *
 * macOS offers neither mechanism, for the same reason.
